My first Scrapy Spider

Just a small spider I made to practise the initial Scrapy skills I got from their tutorial. 
It crawls a subreddit and gets all the images, then goes to the next page over and over an arbitrary amount of times.
Afterwards it outputs an HTML displaying the images in a straightforward way.
